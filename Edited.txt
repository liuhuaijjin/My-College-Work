Martin Luther King
 We could never learn to be brave and patient,

 Perhaps the most surprising thing about mathematics 
is that it is so surprising. The rules which we 
make up at the beginning seem ordinary and inevitable, 
but it is impossible to foresee their consequences. 
These have only been found out by long study, 
extending over many centuries.
E. C. Titchmarsh
 What the caterpillar calls the end of the world, 
the master calls a butterfly.
Richard Bach 
 Two things are bad for the heart 
... running up stairs and running down people.
Bernard M. Baruch
 A fly, Sir, may sting a stately horse and make 
him wince; but one is but an insect, and 
the other is a horse still.
Samuel Johnson 
 Reductio ad absurdum, which Euclid loved so much, is 
one of a mathematician's finest weapons. It is a 
far finer gambit than any chess play: a chess player 
may offer the sacrifice of a pawn or even a piece, 
but a mathematician offers the game.
G. H. Hardy
 No matter how much cats fight, 
there always seem to be plenty of kittens.
Abraham Lincoln 
 A truth that's told with bad intent
Beats all the lies you can invent.
William Blake 
 All our progress is an unfolding, like a vegetable bud. 
You have first an instinct, then an opinion, 
then a knowledge as the plant has root, bud, 
and fruit. Trust the instinct to the end, 
though you can render no reason.
Robert Louis Stevenson
 What is defeat? Nothing but education; 
nothing but the first step to something better.
Wendell Philips
 Any fool can criticize, condemn, and complain 
- and most fools do.
Dale Carnegie
 Education is what survives when what has been learned 
has been forgotten.
B. F. Skinner
 Whoever is careless with the truth in small matters 
cannot be trusted with important matters. 
Albert Einstein 
 Do what you feel in your heart to be right 
- for you'll be criticized anyway. You'll be 
damned if you do, and damned if you don't.
Eleanor Roosevelt
 I read in the proof sheets of Hardy on Ramanujan: 
'As someone said, each of the positive integers 
was one of his personal friends.' My reaction was, 
'I wonder who said that; I wish I had.' 
In the next proof-sheets I read (what now stands), 
'It was Littlewood who said...'
J. E. Littlewood
 Dreams come true. Without that possibility, 
nature would not incite us to have them.
John Updike
 Education's purpose is to replace 
an empty mind with an open one.
Malcolm Forbes
 There was a pause - just long enough 
for an angel to pass, flying slowly.
Ronald Firbank 
 Paradise Lost is one of the books which the reader 
admires and puts down, and forgets to take up again. 
None ever wished it longer than it is.
Samuel Johnson
 When I was one and twenty
I heard a wise man say,
Give crowns and pounds and guineas
But not your heart away.
A. E. Housman
 ...it is more important to have beauty in one's equations 
than to have them fit experiment. 
P. A. M. Dirac
 The most exciting phrase to hear in science, 
the one that heralds new discoveries, is not 
'Eureka!' (I found it!) but 'That's funny ...'
Isaac Asimov
 To have doubted one's own first principles 
is the mark of a civilized man.
Oliver Wendell Holmes
 Beware when the great God lets loose 
a thinker on this planet.
Ralph Waldo Emerson
 There is no scorn more profound, or on the whole more 
justifiable, than that of the men who make for the 
men who explain. Exposition, criticism, appreciation, 
is work for second-rate minds.
G. H. Hardy
 The simple step of a courageous individual is not 
to take part in the lie. One word of truth 
outweighs the world.
Alexander Solzhenitsyn 
 The more original a discovery, 
the more obvious it seems afterwards.
Arthur Koestler
 Education is the best provision for old age.
Aristotle
 Mathematics is the tool specially suited for dealing 
with abstract concepts of any kind and there is no 
limit to its power in this field.
P. A. M. Dirac
 Peace if possible, but truth at any rate.
Martin Luther 
 A man should keep his little brain attic stocked 
with all the furniture that he is likely to need, 
and the rest he can put away in the lumber 
room of his library, where he can get it 
if he wants it.
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle 
 Criticism is prejudice made plausible.
H. L. Mencken
 ...he seemed to approach the grave as an hyperbolic curve 
approaches a line, less directly as he got nearer, till it 
was doubtful if he would ever reach it at all.
Thomas Hardy
 Better a bald head than none at all.
Austin O'Malley 
 A friend is a gift you give yourself.

A. C. Swinburne 
 All truth, in the long run, is only common sense clarified.
Thomas Henry Huxley
 We need men who can dream of things that never were.
John F. Kennedy
 ...most people are so frightened of the name of mathematics 
that they are ready, quite unaffectedly, to exaggerate their 
own mathematical stupidity.
G. H. Hardy
 Guard well within yourself that treasure, kindness. 
Know how to give without hesitation,
how to lose without regret, 
how to acquire without meanness.
George Sand
 What is the first business of one who practises philosophy? 
To get rid of self-conceit. For it is impossible for 
anyone to begin to learn that which 
he thinks he already knows.
Epictetus
This above all; to thine own self be true.
William Shakespeare
Why, sir, if you are to have but one book with you 
upon a journey, let it be a book of science. 
When you have read through a book of entertainment, 
you know it, and it can do no more for you; 
but a book of science is inexhaustible.
Samuel Johnson
God in His wisdom made the fly
And then forgot to tell us why.
Ogden Nash 
The mathematician's patterns, like the painter's or 
the poet's must be beautiful; the ideas, like the 
colours or the words must fit together in a 
harmonious way. Beauty is the first test: there 
is no permanent place in this world 
for ugly mathematics.
G. H. Hardy
The heart has reasons of which reason has no knowledge.
Blaise Pascal
Do not go where the path may lead, go instead 
where there is no path and leave a trail.

 When you have eliminated the impossible, 
whatever remains, however improbable, 
must be the truth.

The shadow is what we think of it; 
the tree is the real thing.
Abraham Lincoln
 The self is not something ready-made, 
but something in continuous formation 
through choice of action.
John Dewey
 Always bear in mind that your own resolution to succeed 
is more important than any one thing.

to solve your doubts; for if you let it pass, the desire 
may never return, and you may remain in ignorance.

for his old wife.

 We have less reason to be surprised or offended 
when we find others differ from us in opinion, 
because we very often differ from ourselves.

say nothing, 
be nothing.
Elbert Hubbard
 One doesn't discover new lands without consenting 
to lose sight of the shore for a very long time.

Remember, a statue has never been set up in honour of a critic! 
Jean Sibelius
 A man used to vicissitudes is not easily dejected.
Samuel Johnson
 I wanted you to see what real courage is, 
instead of getting the idea that courage is a 
man with a gun in his hand. It's when you know 
you're licked before you begin but you begin anyway 
and you see it through no matter what.
Harper Lee
 You cannot run away from a weakness; 
you must sometimes fight it out or perish. 
And if that be so, why not now, and where you stand?
Robert Louis Stevenson
 You may deceive all the people part of the time, 
and part of the people all the time, 
but not all the people all the time.
Abraham Lincoln
 I do not know what I may appear to the world; 
but to myself I seem to have been only like a
 boy playing on the seashore, and diverting 
myself in now and then finding a smoother 
pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, 
whilst the great ocean of truth lay
all undiscovered before me.
Isaac Newton
 Mathematics, rightly viewed, posses not only truth,

 In mathematics you don't understand things. 
You just get used to them.
